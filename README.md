Heroku buildpack to start a Datomic Transactor
==============================================

## What this buildpack does

- obtains and packages Datomic

- prepares Datomic storage configurations

- starts the Datomic transactor

The rest of this README explains the necessary configuration.

## Heroku pre-requisites

This technology exploits the features of [Heroku Spaces](https://www.heroku.com/private-spaces) to securely inter-connect dynos. 

To use this buildpack you need to have access to Heroku Spaces. Outside of Heroku Spaces, Datomic security is not assured.

## Configuring a custom buildpack

To enable this buildpack on an existing project:

````heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/opengrail/heroku-buildpack-datomic -a myapp````

For more options and information see the [Heroku web site on third party buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/third-party-buildpacks#using-a-custom-buildpack)

## Detection

The buildpack will detect that you wish to start a Datomic transactor if your project has a Procfile in its top level directory that has this line:

````datomic: /app/scripts/start-datomic.sh````

## Configuration

### Datomic free configuration - playtime only!!

By default Datomic free will be started. *Data will not be stored between startups*

By default the version of Datomic is the latest published version with `0.9.5344` as a fallback if the latest version cannot be detected for some reason.

You can optionally configure the version of Datomic you wish to deploy.

````heroku config:set DATOMIC_VERSION version-number````

### Datomic Pro configuration

You can get a free copy of the [Datomic Pro starter edition](http://www.datomic.com/get-datomic.html) or bring your supported license.

````heroku config:set DATOMIC_LICENSE_PASSWORD license-password````

````heroku config:set DATOMIC_LICENSE_USER license-user````

````heroku config:set DATOMIC_TRANSACTOR_KEY license-key````

By default the version of Datomic is the latest published version with `0.9.5344` as a fallback if the latest version cannot be detected for some reason.

You can optionally configure the version of Datomic you wish to deploy.

````heroku config:set DATOMIC_VERSION version-number````

### Storage options

The buildpack has support for `Heroku Postgres` and `Amazon DynamoDB`

````heroku config:set DATOMIC_STORAGE_TYPE <TYPE> ````

where <TYPE> is `HEROKU_POSTGRES` or `DYNAMODB`.

By default the buildpack will try to configure for HEROKU_POSTGRES

### Heroku Postgres - Pro editions only

The only Postgres database supported is `Heroku Postgres (free or paid)`

This buildpack will automatically configure Postgres for use with Datomic (if not already done) 

### Amazon DynamoDB - Pro editions only

We aim for simplicity in this buildpack so we reuse the [defaults for DynamoDB that Datomic supports](http://docs.datomic.com/storage.html#provisioning-dynamo).

This buildpack will check that DynamoDB is configured for use with Datomic using the automated setup that Datomic provides.

## Dyno size

The buildpack defaults to 2Gb RAM. In production, 4Gb or more is preferred. See [Datomic documentation on capacity planning](http://docs.datomic.com/capacity.html).

## Dyno count - theoretical

*I have not proven this failover so you will need to work with Cognitect to obtain proper assurances*

In theory, to manage failover for the Pro edition (not starter or free), 2 transactor workers can be started.

```heroku ps:scale datomic=2```

Consult the [Datomic High Availability documentation](http://docs.datomic.com/ha.html) for more details.

## ToDo

- Enable further configuration such as JVM memory

- support other SQL DBs [ postgres and Oracle on Amazon RDS, MySQL Heroku addons (cleardb and jawsdb) ]

- support cassandra via Heroku addon (Instaclustr)

## Basis

This is forked from the official [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack) for Java apps.
